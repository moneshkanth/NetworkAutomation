# Data files - generally better to ignore local run data, but keeping example Jsons if user wants them.
# The user wants to push "the app", so usually we ignore dynamic data. 
# However, usually we might want to keep the structure. 
# For now, I'll ignore the specific large results but keep the history files if they are small or just let them be untracked if they are purely local data.
# Actually, standard practice for this kind of app is to ignore the data files.
